# K-Nearest Neighbors
## Contents
In this project, I import Decision Trees algorithm from sklearn on  dataset about Bio Features of Orthopedic Patients, predicting if the patient is abnormal or not.  finding the optimal K for most accurate prediction data. There are 7 types of data, such as, pelvic incidence,	pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis_angle, etc. Then I processed the data, changing string to integer, finding optimal k to get high accuracy to predict.
