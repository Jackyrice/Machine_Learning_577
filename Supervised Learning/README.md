## Supervised
## Definition 
Supervised learning (SL) is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.[1] It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. (From Wikipedia)

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data miningâ€”classification and regression:

* **Classification** - uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors.
* **Regression** - used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections. Linear regression and logistical regression are popular regression algorithms.
