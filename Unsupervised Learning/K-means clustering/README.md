# K-means clustering
## Contents
In this project, I import an Automobile Customers dataset and import K-means clustering algorithm from sklearn. Then I processed the data, such as cleaning NaN, numeric converting and scaling. There are 11 data types: CustomerID,	Gender,	Married, Age,	Graduated,etc. After clustering, I also used PCA to reduce data dimension in order to have a clear plot and data are clustered among 4 centroids.

## Software
Jupyter Notebook
